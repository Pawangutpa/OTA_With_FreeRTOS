# ESP32 FreeRTOS OTA Blink Example

This project demonstrates how to implement **Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates** on ESP32 while running tasks under **FreeRTOS**.  
An LED blink task runs in parallel with a background OTA service task.

---

## 🚀 Features
- WiFi-based OTA firmware upload
- FreeRTOS task architecture
- LED blink in independent RTOS task
- Arduino IDE compatible
- mDNS auto-discovery for OTA port

---

## 📦 Hardware Required
- ESP32 Dev Board (WROOM / DevKit)
- USB Cable (only for first upload)
- LED connected to GPIO 2 (or onboard LED)

---

## 🛠 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- ESP32 Board Package  
- ArduinoOTA Library  

(macOS works directly.  
Windows users must install Bonjour for OTA discovery.)

## 📡 How OTA Works in this Project

1. First upload via USB (OTA firmware enabled)
2. ESP32 connects to WiFi
3. Arduino IDE detects device over network
4. Future uploads happen wirelessly

## ▶ How to Use

### First Time
1. Open sketch in Arduino IDE  
2. Enter your WiFi SSID & Password  
3. Upload using USB  
4. Open Serial Monitor (115200)  
5. Note ESP32 IP address  

### OTA Upload
1. Keep ESP32 powered ON  
2. Arduino IDE → Tools → Port  
3. Select: `esp32-ota at 192.168.x.x`  
4. Upload new code wirelessly 🎉
